# Code of Conduct

The Internet is a vast space with a diverse community of professionals and enthusaists with an equally vast set of interests and opinions. From this deep well of diversity comes a wellspring of fresh and bold ideas that can further humanity as a whole. But it is this same diversity that can lead to communication failures and discontent.

This document, the Code of Conduct, serves as a general guideline on how the community revolving around this project, and all projects directly under my control, including those here on GitHub, the [System Anomaly](https://systemanomaly.com) website and web persona, personal and public social channels, and any other channels of communication spawned from these. These guidelines apply to everyone from myself at the top all the way down to those wishing to engage with these projects.

Don't take this necessarially as a list of things which cannot be done. It is simply a guideline, which may be enhanced by a set of rules that apply to specific situations, which will be clearly posted if needed.

Violations of this code of conduct are primarly enforced where it is applied, however violations outside of these spaces may preclude an individual from participation in these spaces.

If you believe an individual has violated the Code of Conduct, please send an email to conduct@j3b.in. Please read the section titled **Reporting Guidelines** before doing so, and if you want to know how enforcement is handled, please read the section titled **Enforcement**.

Thank You

## The Code

### Be Kind
The world can be tough at times, and we do not need to be reminded of this fact through these spaces. A kind, considerate, and welcoming demeanor makes this space a better place, and can make someone's day a little brighter. Welcome those who wish to engage with this space, regardless of identity. This includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, immigration status, social and economic class, education level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and ability both mental and physical.

### Be Respectful
In addition to being kind, throught he course of participation in these spaces, one should be considerate and respectful. Your contributions may be used by others, and you may use others' contributations, and your decisions will affect others. Take this in account when making these decisions. Additionally, you may disagree with the decision, action, or opinion of another individual, and vice-versa. Handle disagreements with respect to the other individual. Do not allow frustration to be an excuse for poor behavior, poor manners, or personal attacks. These spaces are intended to be welcoming, and making someone feel uncomfortable or threatened is not productive. Instead, try to understand where the other person is coming from, and make an attempt to address the issue.

Additionally, the following actions are not considered kind, respectful, or acceptable:
- Violent threats or language directed against another person.
- Discriminatory jokes and language.
- Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
- Posting, or threatening to post, other people's personally identifying information (PII), also known as "doxing".
- Personal insults, especially using bigoted language such as racist or sexist terms.
- Unwelcomed attention or harassment, sexual or otherwise. No means no.
- Advocating for or encouraging the above behavior.

## Enforcement
Breaking these guidelines does not always mean immediate expulsion from participation in these spaces. Infractions are investigated and handled on a case-by-case basis. Enforcement may come in many forms, from initial warnings for minor first-offense, requesting that the offending individual apologize to those who were harmed, to finally explusion for the most egregious violations of the Code of Conduct.

Those put in charge of enforcement of the Code of Conduct, the Council, have final say in how it is enforced. A formal request for reconsideration is allowed, but reversasl in a decision is not guaranteed.

## Council Members
- Chair: John Bradley (john@j3b.in)

Because these projects are currently small in nature, the council consists of one member. Positions will open up as projects and related communities grow. The Code of Conduct will be updated as needed.

## Reporting Guidelines
If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, please email conduct@j3b.in. **All reports will remain confidential**. If a public statement is required in the course of enforcement, any identifying information will remain confidential **unless instructed otherwise** by those individuals.

**If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please contact law enforcement first**. If you are unsure who needs to be contacted, please include that in your report and we will make an attempt to notify the appropriate agencies.

If you are unsure if an incident is a violation of the Code of Conduct, report it anyways. Remember, **all reports will remain confidential**, and if a report isn't a violation, no harm will have been done. Likewise, if a violation isn't reported, nothing will be resolved. You will not be negatively looked upon if an incident isn't a violation, and knowing about these incidents will allow us to better adjust the Code of Conduct and processes related to the Code of Conduct as well as adjust specific rules and processes that apply to individual spaces.

Please include in your report:
- Your contact info, so that we can get in touch with you for a follow up.
- Names, real or otherwise, so as long as it is able to allow us to identify the individual that violated the Code of Conduct. Include any witnesses that can back up your report.
- When and where the incident occured. Please be as specific as possible. Also indicate if the issue is ongoing.
- Your account of what occured, and a copy or link to any publicly available record of what occured.
- Any additional context or information that you believe may be relevant.

## What Happens When We Receive a Report
When an incident is reported, the Council will acknolwedge as soon as possible to the individual that submitted the report that we received it an have begun investigations. Once this has occured, the Council will immediately review:
- What happened.
- If this was a violation of the Code of Conduct.
- Who violated the Code of Conduct.
- If this is ongoing or if there is a threat to someone's safety.

If the violation is ongoing or a threat to safety, the Council will work immediately to resolve the situation as best as possible, and may delay an official response until the situation has been resolved.

Once there is a clear picture of what occured, an official response will be issued. It may include:
- Nothing, if there is no violation.
- A public and/or private reprimand.
- A request for public and/or private apology.
- Request the violator to take a break from these spaces.
- Temporarially or permanently ban the violator from some or all of these spaces.

The reporter will be notified of the Council's decision, and any related individuals will be contacted as needed. Public actions are reserved for the most severe violations of the Code of Conduct.

## What If a Report Includes a Violation By a Council Member?
Currently, because the council consists solely of one member, it can be a difficult decision to make a report. This is understandable. There is no real good solution to this problem at this time.

We still request that, if you are comfortable, to report a violation by the Council member, since this will give them an opportunity for self-reflection and self-correction.

*All decisions* regarding violations by a Council member are considered public, and all reprimands to and apologies by a Council member will be public. Individuals making these reports will remain confidential unless instructed otherwise.
